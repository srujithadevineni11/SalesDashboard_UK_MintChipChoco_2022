# Sales Data Dashboard

Welcome to my first Tableau dashboard project! I've learned and implemented the concepts from a YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNLp_JVipoQ&list=PLL4Xs3h2iGfxkvBsJWuuVUrYPRAwA3BEw&index=1), and this dashboard showcases the comparison of sales by country along with the top 10 sales by salesperson.

## Dashboard Overview

This Tableau dashboard focuses on visualizing sales data, highlighting key insights and comparisons. The main features include:

- **Sales by Country:** A comprehensive view of sales data categorized by different countries.
  
- **Top 10 Sales by Salesperson:** Identification and comparison of the top-performing salespersons based on their sales figures.

## How to Use

1. Open the Tableau dashboard file to explore the data visualizations.
2. Interact with the charts and graphs to gain insights into sales patterns and top performers.
3. Feel free to customize and adapt the dashboard for your specific needs.

## Learning Source

This dashboard is a result of my learning journey, inspired by a YouTube video. I want to express my gratitude to the creator of the tutorial for providing valuable insights and knowledge.
